# SecureGuard AI

> AI-powered cybersecurity assistant for vulnerability detection and automated remediation

## Overview

SecureGuard AI is a cybersecurity capstone project that helps developers identify, understand, and fix security vulnerabilities in their development environments. This project was specifically inspired by the critical RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-49596) discovered in Anthropic's MCP Inspector, which highlighted the need for better security scanning tools for AI-assisted development workflows.

The tool combines local network scanning, AI-powered vulnerability analysis, and automated remediation to make cybersecurity accessible to non-technical users while providing advanced capabilities for security professionals.

## Key Features

- **üîç Local Service Scanner** - Detects running services and exposed ports (including MCP Inspector on port 6277)
- **üß† AI-Powered Analysis** - Translates technical vulnerabilities into plain English explanations
- **üõ†Ô∏è Automated Remediation** - Provides guided fixes and automated patching for common issues
- **‚ö° Real-time Monitoring** - Continuous protection with threat intelligence integration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MrRoarke/agent-bootcamp-project.git
cd agent-bootcamp-project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

## Project Status

This project is being developed in phases as part of the AI Agent Bootcamp:

- **‚úÖ Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Core service scanner and detection capabilities
- **üöß Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): AI-powered vulnerability knowledge base (In Progress)
