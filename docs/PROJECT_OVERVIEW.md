# SecureGuard AI - Project Overview

## Project Motivation and Purpose

I was particularly motivated to pursue this capstone project after reading [this article](https://www.oligo.security/blog/critical-rce-vulnerability-in-anthropic-mcp-inspector-cve-2025-49596), which highlights a critical RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-49596) in Anthropic's MCP Inspector. This vulnerability addresses many of the cybersecurity concerns I've had, particularly as open-source tools and LLM platforms become increasingly widespread.

My interest in this project stems from a security and privacy standpoint. We often rely on community-driven projects and libraries, but there's an inherent risk in doing so, especially when we're unsure of the security posture of the code we're integrating. I've personally hesitated to use specific GitHub repositories, even popular ones, because vulnerabilities can easily slip through if the environment is misconfigured or the wrong version is used. Ratings and stars aren't always enough to assess safety.

This inspired me to develop a comprehensive security tool that addresses both local system vulnerabilities AND GitHub repository safety. The tool helps users:

1. **Scan their local development environment** for exposed services and vulnerabilities (like the MCP Inspector issue)
2. **Analyze GitHub repositories for safety** before integrating them into projects
3. **Set up secure testing environments** for evaluating untrusted code
4. **Get AI-powered explanations** of security risks in plain English

I believe this dual approach is not only timely but necessary, especially as developers increasingly rely on open-source repositories and AI-assisted workflows, often without fully understanding the security implications.

## Academic and Professional Goals

**AI Agent Bootcamp Completion:** Completing the first two phases of this project is a goal for me as part of the AI Agent Bootcamp, demonstrating practical application of AI agents in cybersecurity.

**Graduate School Application:** This capstone also strengthens my application for NYU's Cybersecurity Master's program for the upcoming spring semester, showcasing both technical capability and real-world problem-solving skills.

**Real-World Impact:** The project directly addresses two critical security challenges: local system vulnerabilities (like CVE-2025-49596) and software supply chain security through GitHub repository analysis. This dual approach tackles security risks that affect thousands of developers daily.

## Academic Value Proposition

### Why This Project Demonstrates Graduate School Readiness

1. **Real-World Relevance**: Addresses actual CVE-2025-49596 that affected thousands of developers
2. **Technical Depth**: Shows understanding of network security, vulnerability research, and automation
3. **Practical Impact**: Helps real users solve real security problems
4. **Academic Rigor**: Demonstrates research, analysis, and systematic problem-solving

### Key Talking Points for NYU Application

- "Built an AI agent system that prevents vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-49596 while also securing the software supply chain"
- "Created a comprehensive security solution addressing both local system scanning and GitHub repository safety analysis"
- "Demonstrated end-to-end security engineering from detection through automated remediation, including safe environment setup"
- "Applied artificial intelligence to solve pressing cybersecurity challenges in modern development workflows"
- "Developed tools that make cybersecurity accessible to non-technical users while providing advanced capabilities for security professionals"

## Project Scope and Impact

This project represents a comprehensive approach to modern cybersecurity challenges, combining cutting-edge AI technology with practical security engineering to address both local system vulnerabilities and software supply chain security. By focusing on the specific MCP Inspector vulnerability and extending to GitHub repository safety analysis, the project demonstrates both technical competency and the ability to think holistically about security in modern development environments.

The educational value extends beyond just building tools â€“ it encompasses learning modern cybersecurity practices, understanding vulnerability research methodologies, supply chain security principles, and applying artificial intelligence to solve complex security challenges in ways that benefit both technical and non-technical users.
