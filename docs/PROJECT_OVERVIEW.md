# SecureGuard AI - Project Overview

## Project Motivation and Purpose

I was particularly motivated to pursue this capstone project after reading [this article](https://www.oligo.security/blog/critical-rce-vulnerability-in-anthropic-mcp-inspector-cve-2025-49596), which highlights a critical RCE vulnerability (CVE-2025-49596) in Anthropic's MCP Inspector. This vulnerability addresses many of the cybersecurity concerns I've had, particularly as open-source tools and LLM platforms become increasingly widespread.

My interest in this project stems from a security and privacy standpoint. We often rely on community-driven projects and libraries, but there's an inherent risk in doing so, especially when we're unsure of the security posture of the code we're integrating. I've personally hesitated to use specific GitHub repositories, even popular ones, because vulnerabilities can easily slip through if the environment is misconfigured or the wrong version is used. Ratings and stars aren't always enough to assess safety.

This inspired me to develop a repository-scanning LLM tool that helps users identify potential vulnerabilities and offers guidance on how to mitigate them. I believe this kind of tool is not only timely but necessary, especially as more developers depend on AI-assisted workflows.

## Academic and Professional Goals

**AI Agent Bootcamp Completion:** Completing the first two phases of this project is a goal for me as part of the AI Agent Bootcamp, demonstrating practical application of AI agents in cybersecurity.

**Graduate School Application:** This capstone also strengthens my application for NYU's Cybersecurity Master's program for the upcoming spring semester, showcasing both technical capability and real-world problem-solving skills.

**Real-World Impact:** The project directly addresses the type of vulnerability that affected thousands of developers, making it highly relevant to current cybersecurity challenges.

## Academic Value Proposition

### Why This Project Demonstrates Graduate School Readiness

1. **Real-World Relevance**: Addresses actual CVE-2025-49596 that affected thousands of developers
2. **Technical Depth**: Shows understanding of network security, vulnerability research, and automation
3. **Practical Impact**: Helps real users solve real security problems
4. **Academic Rigor**: Demonstrates research, analysis, and systematic problem-solving

### Key Talking Points for NYU Application

- "Built an AI agent that prevents the exact type of vulnerability that affected thousands of developers"
- "Translated complex cybersecurity concepts into accessible tools for non-technical users"
- "Demonstrated end-to-end security engineering from detection through automated remediation"
- "Applied artificial intelligence to solve pressing cybersecurity challenges"

## Project Scope and Impact

This project represents a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity automation, combining cutting-edge AI technology with practical security engineering to address real-world vulnerabilities that impact the developer community. By focusing on the specific MCP Inspector vulnerability, the project demonstrates both technical competency and the ability to respond quickly to emerging security threats.

The educational value extends beyond just building a tool â€“ it encompasses learning modern cybersecurity practices, understanding vulnerability research methodologies, and applying artificial intelligence to solve complex security challenges in ways that benefit both technical and non-technical users.
