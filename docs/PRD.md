# SecureGuard AI - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

Building an AI-powered cybersecurity assistant that helps users identify, understand, and fix security vulnerabilities in both their local development environments and GitHub repositories they want to use. The system specifically focuses on preventing issues like the MCP Inspector CVE-2025-49596 while also addressing software supply chain security concerns.

## User Stories

* **As a developer**, I want to scan my computer for exposed services so that I can identify security risks before attackers do
* **As a developer**, I want to analyze GitHub repositories for security risks before using them in my projects so that I don't introduce vulnerabilities
* **As a non-technical user**, I want to understand what security vulnerabilities mean in plain English so that I can make informed decisions
* **As a busy developer**, I want automated fixes for common security issues so that I don't have to research and implement solutions manually
* **As a security-conscious user**, I want a safe environment to test untrusted code so that I can evaluate repositories without compromising my system
* **As a team lead**, I want ongoing monitoring of my development environment so that I can be alerted to new threats as they emerge

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Setup**: User installs app, runs first security scan of local environment
2. **Local Discovery**: App finds vulnerable services (like unpatched MCP Inspector)
3. **Repository Analysis**: User inputs GitHub repo URL for safety analysis before using
4. **Risk Assessment**: User learns what vulnerabilities mean in simple terms for both local and repository risks
5. **Safe Testing**: App sets up isolated environment for testing potentially risky repositories
6. **Action**: User applies recommended fixes with guided assistance
7. **Ongoing Protection**: App monitors both local environment and provides guidance for future repository selections

## Agent Workflows

### Two-Agent Architecture (Meeting Capstone Requirements)

#### **Agent 1: Repository Security Analyst** 🕵️
- **Identity**: GitHub repository security specialist
- **Primary Capabilities**: 
  - Repository metadata analysis and risk assessment
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning and CVE correlation
  - Static code analysis for security anti-patterns
  - Software supply chain security evaluation

#### **Agent 2: Environment Setup Guardian** 🛡️
- **Identity**: Local security environment specialist
- **Primary Capabilities**:
  - Local system scanning and service discovery
  - Safe environment creation and management
  - Security boundary enforcement and monitoring
