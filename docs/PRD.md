# SecureGuard AI - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

Building an AI-powered cybersecurity assistant that helps non-technical users identify, understand, and fix security vulnerabilities in their development environments, specifically focusing on preventing issues like the MCP Inspector CVE-2025-49596.

## User Stories

* **As a developer**, I want to scan my computer for exposed services so that I can identify security risks before attackers do
* **As a non-technical user**, I want to understand what security vulnerabilities mean in plain English so that I can make informed decisions
* **As a busy developer**, I want automated fixes for common security issues so that I don't have to research and implement solutions manually
* **As a security-conscious user**, I want ongoing monitoring of my system so that I can be alerted to new threats as they emerge

- **User value:** "Fix these issues for me automatically"
- **Technical scope:** System configuration, automated patching, guided remediation
- **Learning goals:** Incident response, security automation

### Phase 4: Intelligence (Weeks 13-16) - Proactive Protection
**Feature 4: Continuous Monitoring & Threat Intelligence**
- **Why last:** Provides ongoing value and demonstrates advanced concepts
- **User value:** "Keep me safe from new threats"
- **Technical scope:** Real-time monitoring, threat feeds, alerting
- **Learning goals:** Security operations, threat intelligence

### Phase 2: Knowledge Integration (Weeks 5-8)
**Features:**
* RAG system with CVE database and security best practices
* Vulnerability explanation engine (translate technical CVEs to plain English)
* Risk prioritization based on user's environment

**Technical Requirements:**
* Vectorize integration for RAG capabilities
* CVE API integration (NIST, GitHub Security)
* OpenAI GPT-4o for natural language explanations

**Agents Involved:**
* **Knowledge Agent**: Identity - Security researcher and educator; Capability - Vulnerability analysis and risk communication

### Phase 3: Automated Response (Weeks 9-12)
**Features:**
* MCP server for system configuration changes
* Guided remediation workflows
* Automated patching for common issues

**Technical Requirements:**
* Custom MCP server implementation
* System integration capabilities
* Step-by-step remediation guides

**Agents Involved:**
* **Remediation Agent**: Identity - Security engineer and incident responder; Capability - Automated fix implementation and user guidance

### Phase 4: Continuous Protection (Weeks 13-16)
**Features:**
* Real-time monitoring daemon
* Threat intelligence integration
* Proactive alerting system

**Technical Requirements:**
* Background monitoring service
* Threat feed APIs
* Push notification system

**Agents Involved:**
* **Guardian Agent**: Identity - Security operations center analyst; Capability - Continuous monitoring and threat detection

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Setup**: User installs app, runs first security scan
2. **Discovery**: App finds vulnerable services (like unpatched MCP Inspector)
3. **Education**: User learns what vulnerabilities mean in simple terms
4. **Action**: User applies recommended fixes with guided assistance
5. **Ongoing**: App monitors and alerts to new threats

## Agent Workflows

* **Scanner Agent → Knowledge Agent**: Pass discovered services for vulnerability lookup
* **Knowledge Agent → Remediation Agent**: Provide fix procedures for identified risks
* **Guardian Agent → All Agents**: Coordinate responses to new threats
* **All Agents → User**: Provide clear, actionable security guidance

## Technical Architecture

* **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
* **Backend**: Next.js API routes for serverless functions
* **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o via AI SDK
* **Database**: SQLite for local data, Vectorize for RAG
* **MCP Integration**: Custom server + official MCP client libraries

## Requirements

### Security Requirements
* All data processing happens locally (privacy-first approach)
